      <h2>Moe Tokens</h2>
      <p>Our token economy is based on the turnover of MOE tokens between consumers of connectivity (devices owned by users) and providers (gateways owned by users).</p>

      <div>
        <p>Tokens provide a native payment solution for connections. They make per-transaction fees possible.</p>
        <p>Moe tokens represent the sum total of connection. As the number of con- nections grows, so does the token value.</p>
        <p>Tokens are infinitely divisible, accom- modating network growth and expansion along the product development cycle.</p>
